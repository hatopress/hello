# Stop the press

### Hello, we are currently reimagining _Hato Press_ <sub>1</sub>
### We are bringing our space back to its original intention, to explore new perspectives and cultures through collaborative projects and publications <sub>2</sub>
### If you are an artist or brand that wants to collaborate with us to produce projects, publications or printed goods, send an email to projects@hatopress.net. For everyday printing needs please take a look at our directory of printers in the UK here <sub>3</sub>.
### For general enquiries please email [info@hatopress.net](mailto:info@hatopress.net)<br>For the store, [hato.store](https://hato.store)<br>And for the studio, [hato.co](https://hato.co)
